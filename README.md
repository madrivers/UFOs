The filters can be used in tandem with each other or individually based on the users' needs.

## Summary
This provides a one stop shop for the retrieval of UFO sighting data.  It is aesthetically pleaseing and relatively simple to use.

As usage increaes, and resources become available, options for improving the page should include:
  1.  A break of data into various pages to allow a user to scroll from page to page vs. down a never ending list with an option to select how many entries to see per page
  2.  The ability to sort results based on column headers to better organize and simplify a users research.
